This directory contains samples of output generated by the model. the checkpoint for the model is in the checkpoint directory,
the two plots using PCA and t-SNE are in the plots directory and the training log is included as well.

Of note, the final report in the training log reports the loss and accuracy on train, test, and validate datasets. of these, test is most
important because it is only used to evaluate the selected model and never used during the training loop.
